Hey [First Name],

Hereâ€™s something most beginners miss:  
They promote products they wouldnâ€™t buy themselves.

I learned this the hard way. Then I switched strategies â€” and only promoted tools I truly use.  
The result? Higher conversions. Happier audience. More trust.

Hereâ€™s one tool I vouch for 100%:  
ðŸ‘‰ [Affiliate Link] â€” it solves [pain point] with ease.

Stick around. Iâ€™ve got more affiliate gold coming your way.  
(Next up: how to write emails that actually sell.)

Talk soon,  
[Your Name]

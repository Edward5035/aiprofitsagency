Hi [First Name],

Meet Rachel. She joined us just 90 days ago, frustrated and stuck.

Now? She’s down 22 lbs, has more energy than ever, and even ran her first 5K.

What changed? She followed our step-by-step system, stayed consistent, and leaned on our support.

> “It felt like I finally had a coach who *got* me.”

Her story could be yours — what’s stopping you?

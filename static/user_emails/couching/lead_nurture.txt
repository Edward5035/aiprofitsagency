Hi [First Name],

If you feel stuck, unmotivated, or overwhelmed â€” you're not alone.

One of the first mindset shifts I teach my coaching clients is this: **"You donâ€™t need to have it all figured out to take action."** Clarity comes from movement, not perfection.

I just posted a short guide on [insert topic or link] that can help you take your next step â€” even if you're not sure what that looks like yet.

You've got this ðŸ™Œ
